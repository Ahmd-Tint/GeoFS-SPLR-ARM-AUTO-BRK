# GeoFS-SPLR-ARM-AUTO-BRK


A powerful but simple Tampermonkey user script that adds two critical keyboard shortcuts to streamline your landing procedures in GeoFS, particularly useful for large airliners and heavy jets.


This script ensures your **Spoilers** deploy and your **Brakes** engage the moment your wheels touch the ground, provided you've armed them beforehand.
