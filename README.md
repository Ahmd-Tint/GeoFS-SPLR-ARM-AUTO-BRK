# GeoFS-SPLR-ARM-AUTO-BRK

A powerful Tampermonkey user script that adds **realistic spoiler and auto brake functionality** to GeoFS. Ideal for airliners and some planes, the script streamlines your landing and rejected takeoff (RTO) procedures.

It ensures your **spoilers** deploy and your **brakes** engage the moment your wheels touch the ground — provided you've armed them — while also supporting **manual braking** when auto brake is disarmed.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Shortcut | Activation | Description |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Spoiler Arm** | <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> | On Touchdown | Toggles the arming state of the spoilers. When armed, spoilers automatically deploy to full when the aircraft detects **ground contact**. |
| **Auto Brake** | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd> | On Touchdown / RTO | Cycles through **RTO → DISARM → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → MAX**. Once armed, brakes are applied automatically based on mode: <br>- **RTO**: triggers if thrust is cut to idle above ~36 m/s, holds MAX braking until ~8 m/s.<br>- **1–MAX**: applies fixed braking levels.<br>- **DISARM**: brakes are fully manual; pilot input is respected. |

## ⚙️ Usage Notes

- **RTO Mode:** Realistic rejected takeoff logic. Brakes **latch at MAX** until aircraft slows to ~0 m/s (~0 knots, ~0 kilometers per hour, or ~0 miles per hour).
- **DISARM Mode:** Auto brakes are disabled. Pilot can brake manually **without interference**. Even hold the parking brake.
- **Auto Brake Levels 1–MAX:** Apply predefined braking levels automatically on touchdown.
- **Spoilers:** Only deploy when armed and aircraft touches the ground.

## Changelogs

* V1: Initial Release (GeoFS is missing the features this addon includes, that's why it was made)
* V2.2 Added levels of braking. (Speedbird came up with this realistic idea!)
* V3.3: Instead of notifications, added the following. "RTO" changes depending on the current auto-brake mode. (Speedbird came up with this realistic idea!)
